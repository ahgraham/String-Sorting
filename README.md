# String-Sorting (created 05/12/2016)
# This program takes as input a list of words (in this test case only four word sentences) and outputs to a table:
# ->The original sentence
# ->The sentence in alphabetical order
# ->The sentence in reverse order
# ->The sentence in progressive order (sorted by lenth, then alphabetically if the length of words are the same)
